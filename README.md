# Welcome to my scripts
Hi everyone!
I'm Sang, from BioTechnology, Nha Trang, Vietnam.
I am a person who interested in bioinformatics and always find ways to discover a new thing for data analysis.
I am  getting started to know bioinformatic when I did my thesis.
And the first thing which I learn was R-studio.
It makes me be interested and put the aim as well as the strategy for continuing career.
I have started and processing NGS using Linux combining R. 
I do self-writing script to data analysis and manipulating to the real data.
The first thing to do that, message errors display on the screen and I have fixed for myself.
Then to after, I have to familiar gradually for write script and it makes me happy,
I really wanna share the script to here after everything is done!
